| Warning: Should not reference property `foo` from here because it is not `const`.
| In Pkl 0.26, typealiases can only reference `const` members of their enclosing module, and this code is considered breaking.
| To fix, either make the accessed member `const`, or add a self-import of this module, and access this member off of the self import.
